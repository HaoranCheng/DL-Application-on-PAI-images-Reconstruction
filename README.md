# DL-Application-on-PAI-images-Reconstruction

This research focuses on applying the UNet and Enhanced Super-Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) models to address specific challenges in photoacoustic
imaging (PAI). Specifically, these deep learning techniques are adapted to enhance image resolution and
quality under four non-ideal imaging conditions: Limited Bandwidth, Limited View, Sparse Sampling, and
Non-uniform Speed of Sound. The work involves integrating sophisticated data preprocessing, augmentation, and fine-tuning techniques to train these models effectively, aiming to improve the
diagnostic quality of PAI in medical settings. This includes enhancing image details and reducing artifacts
that typically arise in challenging imaging scenarios, contributing to the broader effort of refining
medical imaging technology for better clinical outcomes.
